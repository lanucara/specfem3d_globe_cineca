	--with-mic enabled

(modified configure.ac file. configure rebuilt with autoconf -i command)

to install on Galileo@CINECA:

./configure --prefix=/software/specfem3d_globe_cineca --with-mic MPI_INC=/cineca/prod/compilers/intel/cs-xe-2015/binary/impi_5.0.2/include64

# MIC Development EXAMPLES: regional_Greece_small and regional_MiddleEast modified script run_mesher_solver.bash
please, take a look and modify accordingly to your choice (number of CPUs, threads, launch parameters....)

NOTE: run only from compute node (also for compiling and relink executables)
 
# Specfem3D Globe

Program specfem3D from `SPECFEM3D_GLOBE` is a 3-D spectral-element solver for the Earth.
It uses a mesh generated by program meshfem3D.

Main "historical" authors: Dimitri Komatitsch and Jeroen Tromp
  (there are currently many more!)
